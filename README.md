 # 📊 Hotel Review Analysis using BiLSTM

This project is part of the final exam for the **Deep Learning** course. The goal is to analyze hotel reviews using a **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)** model to extract meaningful information from the review text. The model performs **multi-task learning**: it predicts both the **review score** (regression) and the **review sentiment** (classification into Good/Bad review).

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model is based on a **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)** that processes the review text to capture both forward and backward dependencies.

### 🔧 Key Components:

- **Embedding Layer**: Word-level embedding of input review text  
- **BiLSTM Layer**: To capture contextual information  
- **Dropout Layer**: For regularization  
- **Dense Layer(s)**: Fully connected layers  
- **Two Output Heads**:
  - **Review Score Prediction** (Regression Head)
  - **Sentiment Classification** (Binary Classification Head)

### ⚙️ Activations Used:

- **ReLU**: In hidden dense layers  
- **Sigmoid**: For binary classification output  
- **Custom Sigmoid**: Used for review score prediction (bounded regression)

## 🔍 Objectives

- Predict the **review score** given by the reviewer (continuous value between 2.5 and 10)
- Classify the **sentiment** of the review into `Good` or `Bad`
- Use shared representations from the BiLSTM to improve performance across both tasks

---

## 🧪 Experiments & Insights

- ✅ Successfully trained a **multi-task model** using shared BiLSTM embeddings  
- 🧩 Explored using an **autoencoder** to learn compressed embeddings of the review text  
- 📈 Observed improved performance by learning shared embeddings for both regression and classification tasks

---

## 🛠️ Future Work

- 🔧 Fine-tune hyperparameters (e.g., LSTM units, dropout rate, learning rate)  
- 🔍 Integrate **attention mechanism** for better interpretability  
- 🧠 Experiment with **transformer-based models** (e.g., BERT)  
- 💡 Use the learned **autoencoder embeddings** in downstream tasks
